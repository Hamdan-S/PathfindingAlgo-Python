Using Djikstras Algorithm as the idea behind this code I was able to create a python program that gets geoJSON data (for an app challenge) and finds the nearest points between certain coordinates. It's pretty simple and I'm not Newton as math so the internet helped a lot.

_**Current Features:**_
- Get nearest coords
- Get user input

_**To be Added:**_
- Recognize for points with crosswalks and connect those two endpoints together if found.
